# AWS Re:Invent 2018 - An Overview

The jet lag is wearing off, the cold weather of England is back and the bright
lights of Las Vegas are way off in the distance. So now seems like a good time
for a brief recap of my personal highlights from AWS Re:Invent 2018.

# Highlights

### DynamoDB
DynamoDB had some really exciting features making their public release at
Re:Invent. Support for
[Transactions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-dynamodb-transactions/)
is a big win for engineers and allows you to write all-or-nothing changes in a
much simpler way than before.
[On-Demand](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-dynamodb-on-demand-no-capacity-planning-and-pay-per-request-pricing/)
is the other DynamoDB announcement that grabbed my attention last week; I've
always found the capacity provisioning for a DynamoDB table difficult, and
often ended up over-provisioning as a result. Now DynamoDB allows you to create
a table without having to plan your capacity upfront, allowing you to understand
your traffic patterns rather than guessing at them.

### CloudWatch Insights
The CloudWatch team had a relatively quiet week at Re:Invent but I was glad to
see the public release of
[CloudWatch Insights](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-cloudwatch-logs-insights-fast-interactive-log-analytics/).

As you can see from the above diagram, CloudWatch Insights brings fast,
interactive log analysis natively to CloudWatch. I've used tools such as
SumoLogic and Splunk in the past and I'm excited to see how Insights compares.

### Serverless
Just as Werner [teased](https://twitter.com/Werner/status/1068153959058042881)
before his Keynote, Serverless was a big focus point and as such was accompanied
with some really cool announcements.

#### Firecracker
Whilst most of the Serverless features were (naturally) aimed at users of AWS
Lambda, one of the more intriguing releases of the entire week was
[Firecracker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/).
Firecracker is an open-source virtualisation technology that allows you to
create and manage containers. It's used to power both AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate
so it's great to see AWS opening this up to the open-source community.

#### ALB ability to invoke Lambda functions
Personally, this is definitely one of the most exciting announcements from
Re:Invent -
[invoking a Lambda function using an Application Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/alb-can-now-invoke-lambda-functions-to-serve-https-requests/).
Yes, invoking a Lambda over HTTP(S) was possible previously using API
Gateway but the ability to have your Lambda functions and AutoScaling groups
fronted by the same load balancer is a big win.

#### Custom Lambda runtimes
Another release which I'm sure made the weeks of many of the attendees last
week.
[Custom Lambda runtimes](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/aws-lambda-now-supports-custom-runtimes-and-layers/)
allow developers to maintain their own runtimes, allowing you to use custom
binaries, programming languages and versions without having to rely on AWS to
create and manage them. As a engineer who primarily writes Node.js applications
I'm really excited at the possibility of having Lambda functions that can take
advantage of newer language features without having to wait for an official
runtime to be released.

#### Lambda Layers
Released at the same time as custom runtimes was the concept of
[Lambda Layers](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/aws-lambda-now-supports-custom-runtimes-and-layers/).
Layers are an artifact which can be referenced by any many or as little Lambda
functions as you like. These artifacts are uploaded centrally and individual
Lambda functions can then be configured to reference these layers which are then
available at runtime.

# Final thoughts
AWS Re:Invent was a great week, organised exceptionally well (sorting out a
conference attended by more than 50,000 is no small feat!) with some fantastic
features released as well. I'll be publishing another blog post soon focusing
with some tips for attending Re:Invent, so keep your eyes peeled on
