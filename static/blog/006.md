# AWS Re:Invent - Top Tips

[AWS Re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/), AWS' annual week-long
party/conference, can be an challenging week if you aren't prepared properly.
Every year the number of people that descends on Las Vegas, Nevada reaches
eye-watering numbers; this year there were over 53,000 attendees and over 2,000
technical sessions. Re:Invent 2018 was the first year I attended and I was lucky
enough to be accompanied by colleagues who had attended previous years and were
able to provide me with some really good advice. I've noticed quite a few people
on various social platforms such as Reddit and Twitter have struggled with
Re:Invent and were sometimes left disappointed, so I thought I'd turn the advice
given to me into a blog post.

## Travelling between venues
You can't truly appreciate the scale of AWS Re:Invent until you are there. The
conference spans 2.5 miles of the Las Vegas strip from the
[Encore down to the MGM Grand](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Encore,+South+Las+Vegas+Boulevard,+Las+Vegas,+NV,+USA/MGM+Grand,+South+Las+Vegas+Boulevard,+Las+Vegas,+NV,+USA/@36.1167441,-115.1872367,14z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x80c8c5cc93820bd3:0x6c1168e3473cbd5b!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x80c8c2cc6478404b:0x99211dfe55920dc6!2m2!1d-115.1652896!2d36.1290754!1m5!1m1!1s0x80c8c5cc93820e25:0x9dd94505bd76107f!2m2!1d-115.1702533!2d36.102576!3e2).
Google Maps thinks you can walk this in 50 minutes but when you are trying to
fight your way through 53,000 people I'd be pleased if I could do it in less
than an hour. Helpfully, AWS puts on
[free shuttles](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/transportation/) during the week
which, if you make good use of, should mean you won't miss that session you were
really looking forward too. Don't forget to make sure you follow AWS' guidelines
and ensure you are present at least 10 minutes before a talk begins; one of my
colleagues was turned away from a session (that they had a reserved seat for)
despite being 5 minutes early.

## Types of talks
There are a [wide variety](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/) of experiences
and talks available at Re:Invent. I didn't get to any of the boot camps or
workshops (instead focusing on
[Sessions](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/sessions/),
[Chalk Talks](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/chalk-talk/) and EBCs) so I
can't really speak for them. What I can say, however, is that the format for
Chalk Talks is excellent. Chalk Talks are much more interactive than the
traditional lecture format of Sessions - allowing true, detailed technical
discussions to take place. One key difference between Sessions and Chalk Talks
is that every Session is recorded and up on the
[AWS YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/AmazonWebServices) within
24 hours. Chalk Talks, on the other hand, are not recorded at all - so if you
want to see one, the only way to do it is in person.

## Make the most of networking events
One of the things that attracted me to Re:Invent is the amount of people
attending. There's 53,000 people congregated into Vegas and AWS does a great job
at providing networking events (such as the
[pub crawl](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/pubcrawl/)). The Pub Crawl in
2018 dedicated different venues with different topics, allowing you to network
with people interested in a particular technology choice (such as Serverless)
over some free food and drinks.
