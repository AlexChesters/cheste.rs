# Hack Week May 2017 - AFK

For the week commencing 1st May I took part in a hack week at work. I've been
working with Amazon Web Services both professionally and personally for the last
two years or so, but I hadn't had a great deal of experience outside of EC2 or
S3. I chose to spend the week hacking with the lesser-known Amazon services.

One such service is [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/), a
deep learning-based image recognition service. Rekognition has various features
such as _Object and Scene Detection_, _Image Moderation_ and _Face Comparison_.
For my hack I chose only to utilise _Face Comparison_, and thus
[`afk`](https://github.com/AlexChesters/afk) was born.

`afk` is a simple Python program that detects when your have moved away from
your screen and locks your system. It works by using
[`imagesnap`](https://github.com/rharder/imagesnap), a command-line tool for
OS X that allows you to control video devices, such as web cams. `afk` works
by taking a picture using your device's default camera and using Rekognition to
determine if your face is in that picture. If it is, the process starts again;
if it isn't, the screen will be locked and the program will exit.

`afk` utilises Amazon's Python SDK
[Boto 3](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to interact with the
rekognition API. As a result the amount of code I needed to write (28 lines) was
miniscule. The image comparison itself only required 12 lines of Python.

`afk` is available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/AlexChesters/afk), feel
free to take a look and try it out for yourself and let me know what you think!
